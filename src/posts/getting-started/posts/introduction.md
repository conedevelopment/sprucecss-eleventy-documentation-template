Welcome to the official documentation of **Spruce Docs** Elventy theme. A small template that you can use to document any of your projects.

## About the Template

A documentation template is always helpful. There are a lot of solutions to make one; we wanted to create our self-hosted version based on our favorite static site generator.

By structure, it is simple, with two levels and additional custom templates like [FAQ](/faq/) and [Changelog](/changelog/).

## Spruce CSS

The template is built on [Spruce CSS](https://sprucecss.com/), a small and customizable CSS framework. The main benefit of this is that you can use the Spruce UI components with dark mode and RTL support.

<img
  data-theme-mode
  alt="A minimalistic, low-level CSS framework"
  src="/img/cover/sprucecss.png"
  data-light-asset="/img/cover/sprucecss.png"
  data-dark-asset="/img/cover/sprucecss-light.png"
/>
